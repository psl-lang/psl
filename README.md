## Installation

### From the release

Not available now, sorry!

### From Git with Cargo

```sh
cargo install \
    --git https://github.com/psl-lang/psl \
    --tag v0.1.3
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `psl` executable may collide with libpsl (which curl depends on) executable.
> See [psl(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/core/libpsl/psl.1.en) for more explanation. We may rename the package not to collide with that, the potent alternative is `pslc`.`
